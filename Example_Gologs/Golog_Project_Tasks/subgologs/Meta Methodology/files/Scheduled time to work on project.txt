Schedule a 2 hour solid slot to think about, research or work on your task. 

The purpose of this time slot includes:
1) Understanding exactly what the task is, or formulating questions that will help you

2) Researching the ideas behind your task, and following leads to other types of research
-- While you research, you should be creating ontologies in golog to connect references and ideas
-- A golog for each idea, with references and notes on the inside (see examples in tasks I've given)

3) taking notes (as ontologies or otherwise) on how you would explain what you are doing. Write as if you are going to explain to an undergrad student. That is, simply & conceptually, but with details.
